# 📝 Job Application Tracker (Salesforce Project)

This is my first hands-on **Salesforce project**, built as a self-learning aspiring Salesforce Developer!

---

## 📌 What I built:

I created a **custom object** to track job applications with fields like:

- Company
- Position
- Status
- Interview Date
- Application Date

I also implemented:

- ✅ **Validation Rules** (e.g. no future dates)
- ✅ **Formula Fields** (e.g. Days Since Application)
- ✅ **UI Layout Customization**

---

## 🧰 Tech Used:

- 🔹 Lightning App Builder
- 🔹 Custom Object & Fields
- 🔹 Validation Rules
- 🔹 Formula Fields
